# REFACTORING PLAN

## `config.go` Refactoring Suggestions

Based on an analysis by the Gemini AI model, the following improvements are recommended for `config.go`:

### 1. Improve Code Structure with Nested Structs
Group related configuration fields into their own structs (e.g., `HTTPConfig`, `AuthConfig`). This improves modularity and makes the configuration hierarchy clear.

### 2. Separate Parsing from Validation
Move all validation logic into a dedicated `Validate()` method on the `Config` struct. The `NewConfig` function should only be responsible for parsing and populating the struct.

### 3. Apply the Functional Options Pattern for Construction
Use the "Functional Options" pattern to make the construction process modular and composable. This is a highly idiomatic and extensible way to construct complex objects in Go.

### 4. Use a Dedicated Configuration Library
For production-grade applications, adopt a library like `kelseyhightower/envconfig` or `spf13/viper`. They use struct tags to declaratively define your configuration, handling parsing, defaults, and required fields automatically.
