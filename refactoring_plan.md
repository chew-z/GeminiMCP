# REFACTORING PLAN

## `config.go` Refactoring Suggestions

Based on an analysis by the Gemini AI model, the following improvements are recommended for `config.go`:

### 1. Improve Code Structure with Nested Structs
Group related configuration fields into their own structs (e.g., `HTTPConfig`, `AuthConfig`). This improves modularity and makes the configuration hierarchy clear.

### 2. Separate Parsing from Validation
Move all validation logic into a dedicated `Validate()` method on the `Config` struct. The `NewConfig` function should only be responsible for parsing and populating the struct.

### 3. Apply the Functional Options Pattern for Construction
Use the "Functional Options" pattern to make the construction process modular and composable. This is a highly idiomatic and extensible way to construct complex objects in Go.

### 4. Use a Dedicated Configuration Library
For production-grade applications, adopt a library like `kelseyhightower/envconfig` or `spf13/viper`. They use struct tags to declaratively define your configuration, handling parsing, defaults, and required fields automatically.

## Code Review Conclusions (2025-08-10)

Based on an analysis by the Gemini AI model, the following improvements are recommended:

### `http_server.go`

*   **Security Vulnerability: Hardcoded HTTP Scheme (Severity: Medium)**
    *   **Issue:** The OAuth well-known endpoint metadata hardcodes the `http://` scheme, which is insecure in a production environment using HTTPS.
    *   **Suggestion:** Dynamically determine the scheme from the request (e.g., `X-Forwarded-Proto` header or `r.TLS`).

*   **Code Quality: Awkward Middleware Chaining (Severity: Low)**
    *   **Issue:** The authentication middleware is invoked in a convoluted way, making the code less clear.
    *   **Suggestion:** Refactor the `AuthMiddleware` to have a more direct method for modifying the context if it's not used for chaining.

### `direct_handlers.go`

*   **Potential Bug: Silent File Read Failures (Severity: Medium)**
    *   **Issue:** If reading a file fails, the error is logged, but the process continues with a subset of files, potentially leading to incorrect AI responses.
    *   **Suggestion:** Fail fast. Aggregate errors and return them to abort the operation if any file cannot be read.

*   **Performance: Unnecessary Mutex (Severity: Low)**
    *   **Issue:** A `sync.Mutex` is used in a single-threaded section of `fetchFromGitHub`, adding unnecessary overhead.
    *   **Suggestion:** Remove the mutex.

*   **Maintainability: Highly Repetitive Code (Severity: Low)**
    *   **Issue:** The `GeminiModelsHandler` function has a large amount of repetitive error-checking code.
    *   **Suggestion:** Use a helper function to consolidate error handling and improve readability.

### `tools.go` & `context.go`

*   No issues found. The recent changes are clear and well-implemented.
